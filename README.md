## Description
<pre>
I built this portfolio in order to display my skills and technologies.

## Inspiration
<pre>
I admire the idea of portfolios, which will showcase a persons skills
( It's like telling without telling ðŸ˜›).
So I wanted to build my personal brand, which will be able to inform viewers of my work.
I will keep updating this as my potential and experience grow.ðŸ˜Œ
